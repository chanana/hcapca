<p>Once you have selected a node, three more menus will appear asking you to select the <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> axes as well as the <code>total number of molecules</code> you'd like to see on the loadings plot. We recommend rendering no more than 10000 molecules since it tends to slow things down <em>considerably</em>. Each axis represents a different combination of factors responsible for the overall variance in the samples present in the selected node. For a further discussion on PCA, we encourage you to read <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4346">this excellent resource</a>.</p>
